= conflang

Declarative config file "`language`" with ``assert``-based data validation.


== Syntax

First thing anyone wants to see is some example syntax.

.config.cfg
----
name  "Marcus";
age   30;

projects [
   "shql"
   "conf"
];

globals {
   scope  "outer";

   sub-heading {
      scope  "inner";
   }
}
----


== Theory

Writing small shell files that take configuration parameters can be tricky and tiresome.
Do you trust the user's input, or validate everything?
How to handle idempotency?
For an important utility (backups, managing services) it is vital that input is valid.
Crashing half way through a backup because an intermediate path does not exist is bad.
There are often many ways to handle data type mismatches, or invalid input.

I hope to resolve some of those problems with:

. Declarative, validated, strongly-typed configuration files
. Easily accessible parameters for the developer
. Simple to configure for end users
  .. With _optional_ room to add validation & complexity
. Good error reporting for everyone
