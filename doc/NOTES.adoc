Collections of my thinkies, musings, and stuff to refer back to while working on this.

== Bash tomfoolery

Naturally, any project of mine must contain a fair amount of bash tomfoolery.

=== Set, but empty

There are built-in tests for variables that are empty _or_ unset (`test -z`).
However none for declared _and_ empty.
Did some testing to verify how all the parameter expansion for unset/empty vars works:

[source,bash]
----
declare set_empty=''
declare set_value='y'
 
# SET, but EMPTY
[[ ${set_empty:-_}   ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_empty-_}    ]] 
[[ ${set_empty:+_}   ]] 
[[ ${set_empty+_}    ]]  # TRUE

# SET, and HAS VALUE
[[ ${set_value:-_}   ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_value-_}    ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_value:+_}   ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_value+_}    ]]  # TRUE

# UNSET, and EMPTY
[[ ${unset_empty:-_} ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${unset_empty-_}  ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${unset_empty:+_} ]] 
[[ ${unset_empty+_}  ]]

== Properties vs. asserts

I think I've been low-key struggling to justify the "`assert`" piece of the syntax.
I know I wanted something to say "`this value should have some required information`".
Perhaps that was mistakenly ``assert``s, rather than '`properties`'.
Each type has a set of valid properties (obviously user-extensible) that are enforced at runtime.

[source]
----
dirs  array:path  [
   ~/Desktop
   ~/Documents
   ~/Pictures/
] {
   create       : true;
   can('read')  : true;
   can('write') : false;
   elements     : 3;
}
----

'`Properties`' as a concept I think is much more apt for describing the role they play.

It is the next day, and I am thinking about this further.
Isn't `create : true` the same thing as just saying `create`?
We can probably assume a truthy value.

I was thinking maybe there wasn't too much of a practical difference to an `assert` rather than a '`property`'.
Upon further thinkies I believe there definitely is.
Asserts can only say that there shouldn't be more than 10 items in a list, or a path should _already_ exist.
It cannot say to create a path that does _not_ exist.
Nor to make something writeable if it currently is not.

Need to think through the syntax a little more.
Right now it's sorta both a function call, and a key:value pair.
Most of the values are worthless if it's just a true/false.

Are these also tests?
Should `can('read')` do a `$ chmod +r` if it doesn't already have it?
Or should it fail if not readable.

Upon rubber duckying with Ginny, I realized that they're not really properties...
They're '`tests`', or '`directives`'.
The same key may have different meanings, depending on it's test/directive context.

.Example context
|===
| Keyword | Test | Directive

| readable
| File/directory can be read by the current user
| Make the file readable by the current user (`chmod +r`)

| exists
| File/directory exists
| Create (`touch`, `mkdir -p`) if not exists
|===

Tests should fail on a non-0 status.
Perhaps a config option for "exit on test failure", else continue running and report errors at the end.

But how to have a concise syntax to determine which is which?
Ooh, maybe they can become tests if they end with a `?`, else they're a directive.


== Casting

There is currently no casting.
This is a problem if we want to type a directory as a string, to avoid escaping spaces with backslash.


== Subtypes

Would be nice to have subtypes for paths.
`path:file`, `path:directory`, etc.

The typecheck can say it's not a directory, because it doesn't end in a trailing slash.
But the runtime validation will check if the file itself actually is a directory.


== Failing in subshells

If something exits with a non-zero status from a subshell, gotta make sure the rest of the execution does not continue.
Can set a `EXIT=0` before the subshell.
Within the sourced `.sh` file, the final line is `SUCCESS=true ; declare -p SUCCESS`.
The parent shell does a `test $SUCCESS == 'true' || exit 1`.


== Basic grammar

----
program        -> declaration EOF

declaration    -> section_decl
                | variable_decl

section_decl   -> identifier '{' declaration* '}'

variable_decl  -> identifier (type)? (expression)? ';'

expression     -> array
                | string
                | integer
                | boolean
                | path

array          -> '[' expression* ']'
----


== Basic syntax

[source,conf]
----
untyped {
   key1  "value1";
   key2  "value2";
}


typed {
   key1  str  "value1";
   key2  array:str  [
      "one"
      "two"
      "three"
   ];
}


context {
   directories  array:path  [
      ~/Documents
      ~/Desktop
   ] {
      readable    # directive:  must be readable, `chmod +r`
      writable?   # test:       is writable? fail if not.
   }
}
