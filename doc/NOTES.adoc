== Bash tomfoolery

Naturally, any project of mine must contain a fair amount of bash tomfoolery.

=== Set, but empty

There are built-in tests for variables that are empty _or_ unset (`test -z`).
However none for declared _and_ empty.
Did some testing to verify how all the parameter expansion for unset/empty vars works:

[source,bash]
----
declare set_empty=''
declare set_value='y'
 
# SET, but EMPTY
[[ ${set_empty:-_}   ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_empty-_}    ]] 
[[ ${set_empty:+_}   ]] 
[[ ${set_empty+_}    ]]  # TRUE

# SET, and HAS VALUE
[[ ${set_value:-_}   ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_value-_}    ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_value:+_}   ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${set_value+_}    ]]  # TRUE

# UNSET, and EMPTY
[[ ${unset_empty:-_} ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${unset_empty-_}  ]]  # TRUE
[[ ${unset_empty:+_} ]] 
[[ ${unset_empty+_}  ]]
